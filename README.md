Bank account application

The application allows user to 
- create a bank account
- credit/debit the account
- see transaction history
- see current balance

To test the application you can:
- run the com.bank.Demo main method which demonstrates credit/debit, transaction history and current balance of the account
- run com.bank.BankServiceTest class which tests all these usecases

The repository contains such branches:
- feature/US-1 for the first story, debit logic
- feature/US-2 for the second story, credit logic
- feature/US-2 for the third story, history
- master the branch with initial commit, pull-requests should be created to merge features to this branch, it's not done voluntarily to keep all feature branches and potentially see the evolution of the app in every branch
